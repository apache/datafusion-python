TPC-H Problem Statement Query 17:

The Small-Quantity-Order Revenue Query considers parts of a given brand and with a given container
type and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and
pending) in the 7-year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in
revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer
taken?
