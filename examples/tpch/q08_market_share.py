TPC-H Problem Statement Query 8:

The market share for a given nation within a given region is defined as the fraction of the
revenue, the sum of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a specified type in
that region that was supplied by suppliers from the given nation. The query determines this for the
years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.
