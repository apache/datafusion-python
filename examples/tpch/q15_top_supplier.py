TPC-H Problem Statement Query 15:

The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts
shipped during a given quarter of a given year. In case of a tie, the query lists all suppliers
whose contribution was equal to the maximum, presented in supplier number order.
