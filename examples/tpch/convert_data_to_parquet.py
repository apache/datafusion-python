This is a utility function that will consumer the data generated by dbgen from TPC-H and convert
it into a parquet file with the column names as expected by the TPC-H specification. It assumes
the data generated resides in a path ../../benchmarks/tpch/data relative to the current file,
as will be generated by the script provided in this repository.
