TPC-H Problem Statement Query 3:

The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the
sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that
had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more
than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
