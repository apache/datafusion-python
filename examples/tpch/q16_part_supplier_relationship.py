TPC-H Problem Statement Query 16:

The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that
satisfy a particular customer's requirements. The customer is interested in parts of eight
different sizes as long as they are not of a given type, not of a given brand, and not from a
supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented
in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.
