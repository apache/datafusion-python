TPC-H Problem Statement Query 21:

The Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a given nation, whose product
was part of a multi-supplier order (with current status of 'F') where they were the only supplier
who failed to meet the committed delivery date.

# only orders where this array is larger than one for multiple supplier orders. The second column
# is all of the suppliers who failed to make their commitment. We can filter the second column for
