Expressions
===========

In DataFusion an expression is an abstraction that represents a computation.
Expressions are used as the primary inputs and outputs for most functions within
DataFusion. As such, expressions can be combined to create expression trees, a
concept shared across most compilers and databases.

Column
------

The first expression most new users will interact with is the Column, which is created by calling :py:func:`~datafusion.col`.
This expression represents a column within a DataFrame. The function :py:func:`~datafusion.col` takes as in input a string
and returns an expression as it's output.

Literal
-------

Literal expressions represent a single value. These are helpful in a wide range of operations where
a specific, known value is of interest. You can create a literal expression using the function :py:func:`~datafusion.lit`.
The type of the object passed to the :py:func:`~datafusion.lit` function will be used to convert it to a known data type.

In the following example we create expressions for the column named `color` and the literal scalar string `red`.
The resultant variable `red_units` is itself also an expression.

.. ipython:: python

    red_units = col("color") == lit("red")

Boolean
-------

When combining expressions that evaluate to a boolean value, you can combine these expressions using boolean operators.
It is important to note that in order to combine these expressions, you *must* use bitwise operators. See the following
examples for the and, or, and not operations.


.. ipython:: python

    red_or_green_units = (col("color") == lit("red")) | (col("color") == lit("green"))
    heavy_red_units = (col("color") == lit("red")) & (col("weight") > lit(42))
    not_red_units = ~(col("color") == lit("red"))

Functions
---------

As mentioned before, most functions in DataFusion return an expression at their output. This allows us to create
a wide variety of expressions built up from other expressions. For example, :py:func:`~datafusion.expr.Expr.alias` is a function that takes
as it input a single expression and returns an expression in which the name of the expression has changed.

The following example shows a series of expressions that are built up from functions operating on expressions.

.. ipython:: python

    from datafusion import SessionContext
    from datafusion import column, lit
    from datafusion import functions as f
    import random

    ctx = SessionContext()
    df = ctx.from_pydict(
        {
            "name": ["Albert", "Becca", "Carlos", "Dante"],
            "age": [42, 67, 27, 71],
            "years_in_position": [13, 21, 10, 54],
        },
        name="employees"
    )

    age_col = col("age")
    renamed_age = age_col.alias("age_in_years")
    start_age = age_col - col("years_in_position")
    started_young = start_age < lit(18)
    can_retire = age_col > lit(65)
    long_timer = started_young & can_retire

    df.filter(long_timer).select(col("name"), renamed_age, col("years_in_position"))
