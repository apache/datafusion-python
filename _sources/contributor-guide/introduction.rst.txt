Introduction
============
We welcome and encourage contributions of all kinds, such as:

1. Tickets with issue reports of feature requests
2. Documentation improvements
3. Code, both PR and (especially) PR Review.

In addition to submitting new PRs, we have a healthy tradition of community members reviewing each otherâ€™s PRs.
Doing so is a great way to help the community as well as get more familiar with Rust and the relevant codebases.

How to develop
--------------

This assumes that you have rust and cargo installed. We use the workflow recommended by `pyo3 <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3>`_ and `maturin <https://github.com/PyO3/maturin>`_.

Bootstrap:

.. code-block:: shell

    # fetch this repo
    git clone git@github.com:apache/arrow-datafusion-python.git
    # prepare development environment (used to build wheel / install in development)
    python3 -m venv venv
    # activate the venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # update pip itself if necessary
    python -m pip install -U pip
    # install dependencies (for Python 3.8+)
    python -m pip install -r requirements-310.txt

The tests rely on test data in git submodules.

.. code-block:: shell

    git submodule init
    git submodule update


Whenever rust code changes (your changes or via `git pull`):

.. code-block:: shell

   # make sure you activate the venv using "source venv/bin/activate" first
   maturin develop
   python -m pytest

Running & Installing pre-commit hooks
-------------------------------------

arrow-datafusion-python takes advantage of `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to assist developers with code linting to help reduce the number of commits that ultimately fail in CI due to linter errors. Using the pre-commit hooks is optional for the developer but certainly helpful for keeping PRs clean and concise.

Our pre-commit hooks can be installed by running :code:`pre-commit install`, which will install the configurations in your ARROW_DATAFUSION_PYTHON_ROOT/.github directory and run each time you perform a commit, failing to complete the commit if an offending lint is found allowing you to make changes locally before pushing.

The pre-commit hooks can also be run adhoc without installing them by simply running :code:`pre-commit run --all-files`

Guidelines for Separating Python and Rust Code
----------------------------------------------

Version 40 of ``datafusion-python`` introduced ``python`` wrappers around the ``pyo3`` generated code to vastly improve the user experience. (See the `blog post <https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2024/08/20/python-datafusion-40.0.0/>`_ and `pull request <https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/750>`_ for more details.)

Mostly, the ``python`` code is limited to pure wrappers with type hints and good docstrings, but there are a few reasons for when the code does more:

1. Trivial aliases like :py:func:`~datafusion.functions.array_append` and :py:func:`~datafusion.functions.list_append`.
2. Simple type conversion, like from a ``path`` to a ``string`` of the path or from ``number`` to ``lit(number)``.
3. The additional code makes an API **much** more pythonic, like we do for :py:func:`~datafusion.functions.named_struct` (see `source code <https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/blob/a0913c728f5f323c1eb4913e614c9d996083e274/python/datafusion/functions.py#L1040-L1046>`_).


Update Dependencies
-------------------

To change test dependencies, change the `requirements.in` and run

.. code-block:: shell

    # install pip-tools (this can be done only once), also consider running in venv
    python -m pip install pip-tools
    python -m piptools compile --generate-hashes -o requirements-310.txt


To update dependencies, run with `-U`

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m piptools compile -U --generate-hashes -o requirements-310.txt
