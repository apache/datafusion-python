Registering Views
======================

You can use the context's ``register_view`` method to register a DataFrame as a view

.. code-block:: python

    from datafusion import SessionContext, col, literal

    # Create a DataFusion context
    ctx = SessionContext()

    # Create sample data
    data = {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "b": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]}

    # Create a DataFrame from the dictionary
    df = ctx.from_pydict(data, "my_table")

    # Filter the DataFrame (for example, keep rows where a > 2)
    df_filtered = df.filter(col("a") > literal(2))

    # Register the dataframe as a view with the context
    ctx.register_view("view1", df_filtered)

    # Now run a SQL query against the registered view
    df_view = ctx.sql("SELECT * FROM view1")

    # Collect the results
    results = df_view.collect()

    # Convert results to a list of dictionaries for display
    result_dicts = [batch.to_pydict() for batch in results]

    print(result_dicts)

This will output:

.. code-block:: python

    [{'a': [3, 4, 5], 'b': [30, 40, 50]}]
