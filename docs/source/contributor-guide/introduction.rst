Introduction
============
We welcome and encourage contributions of all kinds, such as:

1. Tickets with issue reports of feature requests
2. Documentation improvements
3. Code, both PR and (especially) PR Review.

In addition to submitting new PRs, we have a healthy tradition of community members reviewing each otherâ€™s PRs.
Doing so is a great way to help the community as well as get more familiar with Rust and the relevant codebases.

How to develop
--------------

This assumes that you have rust and cargo installed. We use the workflow recommended by
`pyo3 <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3>`_ and `maturin <https://github.com/PyO3/maturin>`_. We recommend using
`uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ for python package management.

By default `uv` will attempt to build the datafusion python package. For our development we prefer to build manually. This means
that when creating your virtual environment using `uv sync` you need to pass in the additional `--no-install-package datafusion`
and for `uv run` commands the additional parameter `--no-project`

Bootstrap:

.. code-block:: shell

    # fetch this repo
    git clone git@github.com:apache/datafusion-python.git
    # create the virtual enviornment
    uv sync --dev --no-install-package datafusion
    # activate the environment
    source .venv/bin/activate

The tests rely on test data in git submodules.

.. code-block:: shell

    git submodule init
    git submodule update


Whenever rust code changes (your changes or via `git pull`):

.. code-block:: shell

   # make sure you activate the venv using "source .venv/bin/activate" first
   maturin develop -uv
   python -m pytest

Running & Installing pre-commit hooks
-------------------------------------

arrow-datafusion-python takes advantage of `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to assist developers with code linting to help reduce the number of commits that ultimately fail in CI due to linter errors. Using the pre-commit hooks is optional for the developer but certainly helpful for keeping PRs clean and concise.

Our pre-commit hooks can be installed by running :code:`pre-commit install`, which will install the configurations in your ARROW_DATAFUSION_PYTHON_ROOT/.github directory and run each time you perform a commit, failing to complete the commit if an offending lint is found allowing you to make changes locally before pushing.

The pre-commit hooks can also be run adhoc without installing them by simply running :code:`pre-commit run --all-files`

Guidelines for Separating Python and Rust Code
----------------------------------------------

Version 40 of ``datafusion-python`` introduced ``python`` wrappers around the ``pyo3`` generated code to vastly improve the user experience. (See the `blog post <https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2024/08/20/python-datafusion-40.0.0/>`_ and `pull request <https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/pull/750>`_ for more details.)

Mostly, the ``python`` code is limited to pure wrappers with type hints and good docstrings, but there are a few reasons for when the code does more:

1. Trivial aliases like :py:func:`~datafusion.functions.array_append` and :py:func:`~datafusion.functions.list_append`.
2. Simple type conversion, like from a ``path`` to a ``string`` of the path or from ``number`` to ``lit(number)``.
3. The additional code makes an API **much** more pythonic, like we do for :py:func:`~datafusion.functions.named_struct` (see `source code <https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/blob/a0913c728f5f323c1eb4913e614c9d996083e274/python/datafusion/functions.py#L1040-L1046>`_).


Update Dependencies
-------------------

To change test dependencies, change the ``pyproject.toml`` and run

To update dependencies, run

.. code-block:: shell

    uv sync --dev --no-install-package datafusion

Improving Build Speed
---------------------

The `pyo3 <https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3>`_ dependency of this project contains a ``build.rs`` file which
can cause it to rebuild frequently. You can prevent this from happening by defining a ``PYO3_CONFIG_FILE``
environment variable that points to a file with your build configuration. Whenever your build configuration
changes, such as during some major version updates, you will need to regenerate this file. This variable
should point to a fully resolved path on your build machine.

To generate this file, use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    PYO3_PRINT_CONFIG=1 cargo build

This will generate some output that looks like the following. You will want to copy these contents intro
a file. If you place this file in your project directory with filename ``.pyo3_build_config`` it will
be ignored by ``git``.

.. code-block::

    implementation=CPython
    version=3.9
    shared=true
    abi3=true
    lib_name=python3.12
    lib_dir=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib
    executable=/Users/myusername/src/datafusion-python/.venv/bin/python
    pointer_width=64
    build_flags=
    suppress_build_script_link_lines=false

Add the environment variable to your system.

.. code-block:: shell

    export PYO3_CONFIG_FILE="/Users//myusername/src/datafusion-python/.pyo3_build_config"

If you are on a Mac and you use VS Code for your IDE, you will want to add these variables
to your settings. You can find the appropriate rust flags by looking in the
``.cargo/config.toml`` file.

.. code-block::

    "rust-analyzer.cargo.extraEnv": {
        "RUSTFLAGS": "-C link-arg=-undefined -C link-arg=dynamic_lookup",
        "PYO3_CONFIG_FILE": "/Users/myusername/src/datafusion-python/.pyo3_build_config"
    },
    "rust-analyzer.runnables.extraEnv": {
        "RUSTFLAGS": "-C link-arg=-undefined -C link-arg=dynamic_lookup",
        "PYO3_CONFIG_FILE": "/Users/myusername/src/personal/datafusion-python/.pyo3_build_config"
    }
